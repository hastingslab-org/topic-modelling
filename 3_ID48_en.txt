Yes, it is changing. Because in the past, the boss was the boss who was always right. And today everyone has the opportunity, I mean, in the medical field, the bosses used to define themselves, and still do, by the fact that they know the most, somehow, are the most experts in some field, and that's how it was by definition. There was no discussion. And then it was also clear that he is the boss and he knows everything. And today, first of all, the amount of knowledge has increased tremendously. The amount of tools we use has increased insanely. It's impossible to be able to do it all. Or even if there's one person who can do it all, but then they can't run a store, so they kind of don't have any leadership management stuff, right? So all these tools and digitalization, gives everybody the opportunity, even besides the boss, to look for the information and often it's better than what the boss says, right? And so bosses, whether they want to or not, whether they're aware of it or not, they have to say goodbye to the idea that they know and can do it the most. But rather, they can change their work to use all of those resources. So the tools that they can use themselves. that give you more information, but also the resources of the staff. You kind of have a store full of employees who are all better at something than you are. And they can use other tools, digitally. So the amount of information you have at your disposal increases enormously. And I have the feeling that it's also changing the tasks and activities not just of bosses, but of everyone, because they can't just rely on what they learned themselves 20 years ago, but because they can call up many, many more sources. And if you bring them together well, all the sources, the employees together well, then of course you can do much more than before. So yes, it has changed, but definitely for the better.
