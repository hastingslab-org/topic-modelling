Now I have to think about which tools. So one thing, for example, now spontaneously with the conferences that you can now do online. In the past, I thought it was cool to fly to Vienna, for example, and attend a conference there. But now, because I'm also a mom, I think it's even better if you can do a conference or presentation by video and attend. I also have to say that I don't know if it's a woman's thing, but I watch a conference on the computer, for example, and at the same time I can also work or do something else. Maybe then you're not very attentive. But I thought that was cool, it's such a relief now that I don't have to somehow book a flight and fly. But there are also colleagues who see that as a disadvantage, or that you don't have that much contact with people. But I think it's cool. And what else? And I also thought the dictation tool was cool, that it is now written automatically. We introduced that in St. Gallen three or four years ago and at the beginning there was also quite a strike, why do we have to write everything ourselves now? What is the typing office doing now? And afterwards, however, you had a finished report directly, and then the program learns. I thought that was good, too. Relief, really relief, because we have quite a lot of bureaucracy and documentation anyway, anything that can save us time then, I think that's good.
