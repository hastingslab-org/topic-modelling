Well, maybe that's where we come into the study area. All the databases are now digitalized, which is a good thing. But if you have a study, for example, where you have to take various samples, such as cerebrospinal fluid or blood, and you have to scan them in. You then also have a scan code. And that doesn't work. Or the database has crashed. But you have to freeze these samples. Then, of course, it's not a huge effort to do this, but it is tedious. You then have to go to the freezer. You have to wait until the system is working again. It happened today. You have to wait until the system is working again. Then you have to repeat these samples, scan them again, back to the freezer. It's complaining at a high level. But if you had something on paper in front of you, it would be easier at that moment. Of course, it's much more difficult in the long run. That's clear. But it would be easier in the moment. And sometimes it's annoying when it doesn't work. Or when you've entered something, it's taken half an hour, and then you click Next and it's gone. That's annoying. All our papers, our scientific papers that we submit, that's all digitized with you. I'm sure it is. And you fill out a list of authors, 30 authors, that's rare. And you click on and they're all gone. That makes me want to cry. Sometimes I think about never submitting that paper again. But then of course you don't do that either. That makes me really sad and angry.
