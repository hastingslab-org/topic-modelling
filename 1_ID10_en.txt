One improvement was this dictation software. That was a great help, that you could also work with text modules. And that was also the great thing about clinical information system, that you could share text modules with others. So I learned a lot by having other people send me text modules. That's how I learned how to write letters there. And so I found it a good way to learn from each other by sharing the text building blocks. And separately, this software with the dictation, of course, is a great help. Efficiency gain, of course, when you know, okay, maybe it's really only there for 10 hours instead of 12 hours. And yes, I already have the feeling that it improves the quality if you know how to write good letters.
