Yes, the anesthesia system was introduced before I came. Before that, all the protocols were kept by hand. Digitally, it is certainly much better for the patient because the vital signs are documented automatically. Especially in critical situations, you don't have to document that as well. That is certainly better. So, there's a curve that's designed exactly the same as when you do it by hand. So that's super.
