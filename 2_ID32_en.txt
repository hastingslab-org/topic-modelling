I would say that these are classic IT problems, that a system doesn't work and you want to continue working somehow and then it takes forever. It's probably only 30 seconds that the system needs until it has somehow rebooted itself or starts up again. But that's when you're in your work process and time resources are of course very important in our field. These are situations where you realize that you could go a little faster. But I think that's quite normal, and it won't be possible to avoid it in the long term. I think it's also a subjective feeling. 30 seconds isn't a lot, but that's when you think you're moving forward, and it seems like an incredibly long time.
