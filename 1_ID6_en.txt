Okay, so positive situation, they came, for example, from being able to use technology or digital tools to add something new or to gain time. So, I think gaining time, now it is something very, very important because we have a lot of administrative tasks, and it takes a lot of time. So, I feel very satisfied and as if it could be very simple because recently, I tried to use ChatGPT to write reports. I was really very satisfied because I can gain a lot of time. It is not so perfect. So, I put the information, I have to say: write me a report or reframe those data to have report. Then I need to modify it because it is more easy than writing everything. And sometimes I try, for example, now we have some clinical problems and I try to ask, for example, ChatGPT to say, in this clinical problem, what are the main three diagnoses or four diagnoses that we need really to pay attention to? So, they start with very generative responses. So, I ask him, listen, I am a psychiatrist, I need something deeper. And we have some deep information that needs also to be aware critic, but the feeling is really satisfaction, that you can have such tools that could help us to gain time, and maybe have some additional information that it is not maybe possible to do it in the routine. So, this feeling of satisfaction, the feeling of being more efficient, the feeling of being smart, maybe because we use something new or original. And for maybe the usual tools that we use in the daily practice, yes, sometimes it could be something that helps to do things in a more efficient way. And sometimes I remember because I worked in the past with everything in paper. So, there is a lot of gain in time and efficiency. So even if it is not too perfect, it is really very interesting. The possibility to share information with colleagues, to see it very quickly, to see and check quickly. It is something that gives me this feeling of satisfaction of being efficient.
