So I think the X-ray program, with the lecture from the colleague. First of all, I personally like to look at pictures, because I am a very visual person. That is, with pictures I am personally already picked up. So I also always look at pictures of all my patients. That tells me more than the written word. I used to do a lot of photography and black and white and CT black and white, MRI black and white, so that's kind of what speaks to me personally in my thinking and my way. And when she showed that, where she stores things, then for me was still very cool, then I can also look if I would have found it. And that's a certain efficiency because maybe I don't necessarily have to look for it myself if I don't have time. So that was certainly something that was very positive. So, I think, on the one hand, by the fact that the figurative appeals to me personally and then just the efficiency that I gain time.
