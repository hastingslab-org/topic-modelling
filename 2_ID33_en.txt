The system with which we document at the ICU, which is a different version, a different model. It reminds a bit outdated, and the system is limited by the number of spaces. That means you just have one page and you can write your diagnoses there. And when the page is full, you have no more space. Then you have to make the writing so small that you can't read it at the end. Or you write it on the next page, where the next person might miss it. It's the same with the medications. You have a list, so so many lines of space to prescribe medications. And then they come on page 2. That then also jumps because it has prioritized certain medications, for example, antibiotics and IVs. That then comes back to page 1. And then if you don't sight it, then you don't see it.
