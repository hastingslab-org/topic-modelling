Yes, I think that was once a situation when I was still in the other city. I was on picket duty, only via my cell phone. And I had no reception somehow. I don't know why, because my cell phone was on strike and I didn't even realize that it wasn't working. And they tried to call me and it didn't work. And they didn't have any other way to contact me. And then they had to call someone else who would come and help. And at some point I saw that I had five missed calls.
