I think a big problem is actually with this digital file, by having everything in one place, it's extremely cluttered and sometimes I wish it was like my apps where I just open up the particular app to see that relatively simply because there's just too much in one place in this digital file and I find that little in many places easier and clearer, I've found, when I use digital things. Then it is fear to miss something. That's it. Because I have, so it's fear of missing something.
