So, I would already say that I found the radio-oncology information system, or I find it a positive tool, because many things work better with it than with other systems. It's certainly not perfect, but it's already the case that I find that positive, that the documentation somehow works. And just this care path system that one action triggers something else and that triggers something else. That's very structured and I think that's really good, I feel that's positive. Because it also ensures that nothing gets lost and that you can also use that well. The workflows are really structured and orderly. And that there is actually little to no room for error at this point, due to the fact that this is also such a structured care path system. So, you have your work list, where you can see exactly what's going on, where you can see which tasks are open and which are not. And then you have to work through them.
