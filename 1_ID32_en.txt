What I find incredibly positive is when a patient is not well, for example, the patient is acutely worse, and if you then have your trolley with you and have all your information with you. Then you call the doctor, and everything is immediately available, you don't have to sort through 30 sheets of paper and look at what he has done here, what do we have somehow, in the best case any X-rays that would still be analog, which of course everything is no longer. But the fact that you can then really say that it really is an emergency situation, I have all the information that I have there, I can help the patient immediately, that is a good thing. So, the interprofessional team has all the data it needs and can basically get started right away. That's something that I always find totally positive for me, to be able to help the patients as quickly as possible. And at the end of the day, it also increases patient safety that we can also react correctly relatively quickly and promptly.
