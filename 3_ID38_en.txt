I don't think so in essence. The profession still makes a lot of difference and how you deal with patients. The general problem is that more and more documentation is needed. Someone older might say it differently. I have always experienced it that way. I think it's important, because it's just the future, to document, and that we have a system, if possible, that doesn't take away from our time with the patient. It's my job, of course, my time with the patient is not taken away because I'm operating. I am sometimes operating for 6 hours. I have nothing to do. In the time that I'm physically with the patients, I feel like I'm doing the exact same thing that I'll be doing 20 years from now. It's just important for me to see what I've operated on. And to do it on the patient. That's why I personally don't feel that it makes me a different doctor.
