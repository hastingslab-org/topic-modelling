Yes, I have an example off the top of my head. It's a program from a company that manufactures blood glucose sensors. And there's a cloud-based version. Or you can read in devices and then you have an overview of your blood glucose levels. I think the program is relatively good, intuitive and nicely presented. Not everything is great, but most of it is pretty good for everyday use. You might need three or four times to understand how it works. But after that, it gives you a good overview and the same type of presentation for common everyday situations. So it's satisfying to quickly have the data that is relevant to you, to be able to make an assessment and then adapt therapies or give advice. The fact that you can discuss certain situations that have occurred in the last few days, unusual blood sugar levels, directly with the patient on a one-to-one basis, like having a diary that you can go through. It is also satisfying when the patient has a question about something that has just happened, you can go back in time and look at the moment together. It's very gratifying that the program is so clearly structured.
