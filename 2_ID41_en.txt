So the worst thing you can do is that you have to do a work step twice. And in reality you do the work steps tenfold. I have it an example. If a resident makes a new diagnosis and prescribes a medication, the goal is to have that already on the report without the resident having to write that report. If you have a patient who has a bedtime of three weeks, then it may be that he then has three different residents. It may be that the patient has an intravenous antibiotic therapy in week two. At the moment when the discharge report automatically states important therapies, key point antibiotic therapy from week 38 to 39. Automatically at the moment when you prescribe this, or when the prescription is stopped, then it is incredibly good. When laboratory results flow into it via artificial intelligence and you can generate a discharge report with it, so to speak. That is incredibly good.
