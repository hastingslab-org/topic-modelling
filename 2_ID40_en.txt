Yes, the hospital information system is a very unstable program. It crashes regularly, even on rounds, which is a real pain. Or if another update is installed, then you can't use it. That happened recently, unfortunately. And then the interface doesn't work either. Today that happened very, very often. But that's also because a new update was just put in yesterday. So basically, it crashes a lot when you do ordinances over the targeted curves. But that's going to be new now or should be new. Yeah, and otherwise it's just tedious. It's just the waiting time in general. Every second you wait for the lab to load, when you're switching back and forth, it's just tedious.I usually click countless times, and then afterwards it says close program and then I open it again and have to log in again.
