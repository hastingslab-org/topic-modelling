During the navigation, if you are operating on a deep structure, for example, if you are in the area of the pineal gland, the pineal gland, that is quite far away from the surface. The head seems so small, but if you are 10 cm deep, you don't have much space, that's the brain. And maybe it's not so satisfying now, but it's a reassurance. I think that's also a positive feeling. You're planning your surgery from the inside out, so to speak. Where do I have to go? And that's how I choose my approach. Also in terms of what are eloquent areas, what are important areas that would otherwise fail. And when you start to pave your way there, you keep navigating. That is of course a positive reassurance that gives you confidence again. Yes, I'm on the right path. I'm not breaking anything that I shouldn't. I do think that these videos are good for patients, for most patients. And not just for the patients, but also for the relatives, these educational videos. Of course, we can't do an information session with 20 family members. I don't have the capacity for that. But if you print out this QR code once and hold it up to the patient and say you're welcome to watch it with your family. And then these 20 people look at it, who have 20 family members who want to see it. They come and say, I thought it was really good, it helped me to understand what my relative is going through now. That's quite nice.
