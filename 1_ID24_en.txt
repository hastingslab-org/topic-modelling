So I think now, the most obvious thing is with the intensive medical concern system, right? So if I just don't have time, for whatever reason, because with us it's already often pretty round overall. If I don't have time to really look at the patient in detail, clinically, and make up my own mind. And now I have to talk to a colleague on the phone or something, because the patient needs some kind of negotiation or some kind of examination, and he asks me, you, how is that and why is that and so on. And then I open that up and think, ah yeah, great, there I have the value, there I have the value, that's exactly what I need. And then I think to myself, thank God, because otherwise I would have run back to the patient now, and then back to the phone again, when I'm calling from the landline now. And I think from that point of view, you're glad to have these overview tools, or this patient management system and intensive medical ordering system, when you have everything immediately available in one place. That already makes it easier.
