So, something that almost drives me up the wall every day is an email with the message the inbox is almost full. We have a limited amount of storage on our email account. But by that at this hospital everything goes to everyone, or CC to everyone, or they have a pre-made dispatch group that we get everything and friendly reminders for continuing education where no one goes anyway. And also discharge reports do not run in MedFolio but are sent out. Then there is still a filing with sent and then again the input, because one is again in the copy with it. You can't manage this amount of data. And there you have to look again and again, which are the largest files that I can delete. And it takes a lot of effort to keep the email inbox clean. I once read somewhere and found that totally plausible: the mailbox is like a mailbox. You don't take out an envelope, read it and put it back in, you put it in the trash to delete or in a folder. But the mailbox is empty and I can't do that anymore because I don't have enough storage space. I get reminded several times a day and that's really... there I find if how already communicate and handle everything via email, they have to give us more storage space. That annoys me. And something else that also annoys me mega, because slowly everything is digital, is that the backup of the data is not solved. I have a lot on a stick that I'm mobile, at home on a hard drive, then a backup on the desktop and yet I always have to remember and make a current backup once a month. I feel like if everything is already digital, it should be simplified as well. If my house burns down, all my sticks and my hard drives are gone. That's not solved, I think.
