Yes, I would say the most positive or the most helpful is actually always in an acute situation the translation tool, because otherwise you're just helpless and can't do anything. You just have to say that. You're in a situation before that when someone doesn't speak the language and it's super important of course with us that you can communicate, then you don't even know what you want to do, then you can also send him home actually. But with this tool, I can still use the time of both of us sensibly, so that we can achieve an outcome and often, of course, not to the same extent as when I speak the language as a native speaker, there are still, especially because we have many older patients, who do not know how to speak into the microphone and so, that is sometimes not so easy, but overall I would say, we get more to a goal and then I am actually relieved, I am relieved, but still annoyed. Relieved, but still annoyed that there is no translator properly. So that's not quite sufficient yet, the system. 
It is an app that I can record with, I can enter things, like with Google Translate actually, I can enter which language I speak, which should be translated, then I press a button, speak in, then that is also immediately translated back into writing, then I could once show the person the written script and I can also modify it if there was an error and then I can also press play and then that is read out by the app, which I have so to speak dictated into the thing purely and so the other way around. And sometimes that doesn't work one hundred percent, but overall it's a big help.
