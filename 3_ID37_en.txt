Yes, both. I think it's changing. We are already observing that it is changing. I would say that perhaps we need to differentiate a little bit between the various professional qualifications or training within nursing. A specialist or a nursing assistant is, of course, more at the bedside. Little in the digitization or documentation on the PC. The graduate nurses are already tending to be more and more involved in digitization. From my point of view, the progress of digitization is not the issue. If this were so advanced, then there would have to be a reduction in the workload. But I think it's more the issue of how much you have to document. There are more and more demands on what you have to document for legal reasons. That inevitably changes the job description of nurses and also the . content of the tasks. We are already observing this today. Compared to 20 years ago, a qualified nurse already says that she works much less directly at the patient's bedside, but is much more confronted with coordinative and organizational issues, which are also documented afterwards. This is certainly a development where one must now consider whether it is good or not. From my point of view, it should lead to digitalization supporting us and leaving us more time for the patient. And certain things will also be automated in the future. But at the moment, the trend is that the profession is changing in such a way that the number of digital tasks has increased significantly. This is not necessarily due to the tool, but also to the processes. That more needs to be documented or managed. From my point of view, it's not the tools, but the tasks and the processes.
