Yes, so the ECG system, that is the absolute no-go program for us. And everyone who is on night duty, you come in the morning and the one who is on night duty is still sitting there and says, now I'm back. With the program for two hours just to sort out any artifacts. And if I just think about what this program costs. Just the implementation of such a program, what that cost again. Yes, and the benefit that comes out. So frustrating.
