I have to think about it right now. I'm probably not the person who associates extremely good emotions with tools. I would also say, for work, I expect a tool to really perform these functions reliably. Compared to this HRM tool, that's really an imposition. It has something more on the level where I think, now we're talking about saving time. And now I'm being expected to work like this. I find that rather associated with very negative emotions. But it is actually the case that I assume that this is simply a given.
