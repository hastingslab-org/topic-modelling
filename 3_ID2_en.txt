Digitalization is help, but it should be much better. It is incomplete. It needs better user guidance, but it's not about more autonomy. It is cumbersome to use, it has not been further developed. A modular system was bought, a Lego system, and we were told that a tender would be put out to find the best system that we could use in St. Gallen. And as soon as we bought it, we were told that nothing would be built on site. And that's pretty weird. And then we said that's not how it works. Yes, just take the "standard", but there is no standard. There is of course a database in the background and Oracle, but what is displayed to the user is what you define and what should happen with the click. The manufacturer has solved this differently in each company. In this respect, it is a Lego system. Or let's take Microsoft Access as an example. This is already programmed and a finished product. But you have to design the forms and say what happens. And then we said we had to have forms, and then we were told we could define 5 forms, and then we said it would be difficult with 5 forms. And then we had 5 forms built, which are an egg-laying wool-milk acid and are correspondingly difficult to use. But the whole canton works with it and it works. But it's not ideal, and I would have had lots of ideas on how to make it better. But they said we have no money and we can't build it ourselves.
