Yes. The electronic medical history, of course, was a game changer. Suddenly having access to everything everywhere, even at home or on the train or whatever you name it. But I think this is a banal digitalization. We have measurably improved the recording of services through digitization. That has really shown itself. So, the performance recording, that's tedious, especially with the crosses, and then someone has to transfer that, and that's very error-prone, and a lot was forgotten. But the digital benefit recording has generated a lot of additional revenue, so money that you just didn't have before. It's probably been some of the most effective stuff that we've put in place. And now we're eagerly awaiting the new hospital information system that's coming. And the data quality, definitely. If you digitize and automate standard processes, then they are more constant in quality, usually better, but above all more constant and no longer individually dependent. I think that's what we've done. And that's where we've also relieved the burden on ourselves, the people who are involved in this. That makes an extreme amount of sense. That's certainly very positive.
