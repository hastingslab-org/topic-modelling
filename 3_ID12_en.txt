Yes, I think in general I was a bit naive when I became a doctor and had the feeling that I wanted to be a doctor because I work with people. And it disillusioned me a bit when I realized how much I would be doing on the PC. I don't think it has to do with the tools specifically, but just in general, how much I do on the PC and then already that it annoys me when then just the tools don't work and I spend even more time on the PC because of that. For a long time before I started working as a doctor, I worked in a company in CT during my studies. There I actually learned what it means to work on the PC, so I can also use Excel and so quite well.  And it's actually not so different, if it weren't for the patients, from working in the KV. And in this respect it has already changed me a bit... The image of a doctor has already changed in my eyes, especially as a resident. I think it will be better later, but as a resident. It is not necessarily the tools themselves that make it easier or harder, but not the tools themselves.
