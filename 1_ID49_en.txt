So sometimes, even if a tool sends a reminder. For example, in the OR software we enter when the patient came, when we give him to the OR. And that's just a time saver. We make one click and we don't have to write down that we took the patient to the OR, we make one click. And afterwards, you can look up everything, including when we took him to the OR. It's like a thought support that takes a lot of my mind off things. And I can also look up the prescriptions. I also find it much more pleasant than all the paper stuff, and in the end they don't hand it in because they forget to give it to the patient. And I find it difficult to have negative experiences, especially when the doctor doesn't stick to it. But I don't notice the tool itself. We just don't use so many innovative things. But the digitization is not that far advanced. I still do communication on paper.
