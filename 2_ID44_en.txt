Not everything is ideally designed. You can see that other large hospitals are now switching to a system where everything comes from a single source, where this crosstalk between the systems works much better. For example, the planning of patients or which patient gets which appointment. The corresponding appointment is in our RIS and the planning of the clinical consultation is in the HIS. There are difficulties. If a patient calls the clinic and says he can't come that week, the appointment is deleted from the HIS. If no one remembers to inform the radiology department, the appointment remains in our system because we don't receive a message. These things sound relatively banal, but they are very difficult to manage on a large scale. And if we can make digitization smoother or smoother, so that automatic messages come, then we could release this busy appointment for another patient who may have to wait because this appointment is supposedly taken.
