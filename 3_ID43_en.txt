That can actually be. The hospital information system influences it, because there the rights depending on the role I have, I also get permissions for certain reports. And there, of course, it depends a lot with the understanding. If, for example, I can and am allowed to edit the doctor's report and have the rights for it, then it is actually, of course, only the tool that allows me to do it. That would otherwise also be possible in another area. But if it were all analog or via dictation machine and handwritten, then it would be different, whether I'm allowed to do it or not. But in a subtool, the role is exactly defined and the rights are negotiated, whether I can just influence and write into a report. Yes, that already influences in a way how I perceive myself in my professional role. So the rights that I am granted and assigned in a tool influence that, I would say.
