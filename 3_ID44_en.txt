Yes, I don't think that the image of the doctor will change much. In radiology, we have been using these digital tools for a very long time and I believe that they are simply aids that we can use, but where the core idea of the activity does not change. I also believe that in the next five to ten years, when many more artificial intelligence products will be on the market, that we will be able to do certain things much faster, that we will be able to do the work where a person has maybe five minutes and then the first person looks at it is a resident and the second person is a senior physician who looks at it again, that maybe the first step is done by the machine and that in the second step a person with experience looks at it again and checks the plausibility, is that really true? Because as people with experience, as doctors with experience, we can often say relatively quickly that this is not true, or yes, this is good. And I believe that this is the direction in which it will go. And from that you can say that in the future probably the picture could change. But I think we are not there yet.
