No, not necessarily. For me it's always the same. Although, when I started as an assistant physician, we really only had a PC with a Word document on it, which was a better typewriter, so to speak. And I think whether I document on paper, whether I have findings, ultimately I'm the interface. So I have, as you say nicely, it's tools. Whether I have a piece of paper, or a pencil is a tool that helps me. And ultimately, I have to treat the patient with the tools that I have available. So on the contrary. The tools help me to do my work better.
