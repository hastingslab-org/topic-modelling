I don't think that changes me. I think that's simply the general development in every industry. It's not just the healthcare sector that is or will be digitized. There are many other industries that are also affected by this. I think it's simply the spirit of the times. It's the general development that we have in all sectors. I don't think it affects my profession specifically, but I think the healthcare professions themselves are a separate group again when it comes to digitization because it's very sensitive data. And because you can do a lot of damage with it. For example, if the data were to fall into the wrong hands or something.
