I've never thought about that before. I'm probably now a generation that knows both situations well, i.e. without digital tools and with. And for me, it's normal that I learn the ropes and accept that and deal with the team. I don't perceive this as a reinforcement, but for me it's normal. However, I have also experienced situations where colleagues who were at the end of their working lives and no longer accepted such things. I can imagine that it is difficult in such a situation. Because it might make you aware of your own inabilities or show you that you might have missed something or that you might not be able or willing to learn anymore. For me, it wasn't an issue because I belong to the generation that is now simply coming in on time with this increasing digitalization. That's why it doesn't really change my image.
