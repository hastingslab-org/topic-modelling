The frustration threshold also gets lower over the years. So you get upset more quickly when something doesn't work again and it doesn't work and the PC doesn't work. Or you notice that at the beginning everything is a little bit okay and then after a few years you think, yes, then you become a little bit more troublesome. So at the end of the day, I think the problem in general is that we always have a time pressure from morning to night. So it's always a time crunch and you're dependent on the course of the day just being fluid, that the technical things work. These are very marginal things, that a printer works when you need a printer, that a PC doesn't, if you need to get to the PC faster now, somehow you have to do a software update and these are just things that you have more often. Yeah, that's, it's all networked and you can print everything with your, with your badge you can print anywhere, but you still have outages every now and then, then something doesn't work and that's usually when you really need it the most. So it's somehow when you have to present reports, we have reports in the morning, at noon, where you always have to prepare everything, of course, you're dependent on technology, you're dependent on your monitors working, and it's often the case that something doesn't work, and of course your superiors don't usually care why it doesn't work, it just doesn't work, and that's a bit of what makes you a bit angry.
