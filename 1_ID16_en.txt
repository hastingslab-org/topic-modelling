The difficult thing is that you always better remember the frustration. So positive, so I think already many. So for example, what I said that from home, I think that's really something extremely valuable. When someone showed me how to use my cell phone to open the web-based form of the PACS program. That was absolutely positive because all of a sudden I didn't always need a PC on duty outside to look at images. But I also didn't have to rely on videos, but could at least look at them myself. And I opened it at a dinner with colleagues, then the assistant doctor called. I opened it at dinner with colleagues. And I had it on my private cell phone. And the resident called on the work cell phone. That means I was able to look at it in parallel, so to speak. And the colleague on the side says, how do you do that? That's cool, you can use that. And that was such a classic example of it, it's there, people don't know it. And you see it in somebody else and then you can implement that yourself. But I was personally happy for me. And that made somebody else very happy too, to see that possibility, that's possible. But no one ever broadly propagated anywhere that that existed. It was more like, hey, do you know this? And that's how you come to it. And that's a pity that you only have things like that. And the other thing would be remote access to the clinic. That you can access things from home, that you can go home again. And you can also correct or read things from home if necessary. It makes it easier to keep appointments later in the evening. But it makes it incredibly difficult to separate work and private life. So it's just always possible. Those were really such positive insights. But that this is not propagated differently. You can also use it that way. Yes. So there is no introduction, no training. These are the possibilities that are available to you. It's more like, you look at how others do it and learn something for yourself.
