Yes, that very transcription software. I've mentioned that a couple of times, but that really should actually make our lives easier and actually makes life more complicated because we don't have the option anymore to dictate our reports differently and the tool doesn't work most of the time though or at least about half the time it doesn't work. Be it simply, I speak, it records me, but it doesn't transcribe or it doesn't understand me, which I just also know like the child of my generation from other apps that just work 10,000 times better, that are just open source, open access available somewhere and I'm already aware that that's not possible for privacy reasons, but it's a bit of a mystery to me how a system that we use here can be so bad and our systems that are open access are so good for it.
