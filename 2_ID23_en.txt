Yes, they are more like everyday annoyances. When the tools don't work, when it's a hassle to use them. So it's e-mail. If you get 70 new e-mails on the weekend in the night from Saturday to Sunday, then I have to say that something is probably wrong with the system. Or, what I personally don't like at all is when these automated messages come in. That's a good idea, how machines and humans are supposed to work together, if those are part of the load. And that happens quickly, because they are simple, simple ideas that are then simply implemented. So when the system reaches some point, it sends me an email, I'm supposed to do something about it and that's extremely annoying. People don't accept that either. And of course there is a quick reaction when you have a problem, then the first answer is always "We have a tool". And then someone starts, probably for a lot of money, to develop a tool with someone else. And whether that is good or not, really good results, lean, simple, but smart results are often rare. It's also often not targeted or aligned. Those are the problems, yes. I have another example. The canton stipulated that the diagnosis code of all cancer patients had to be reported to the cancer registry. Then quickly came the order "Yes make a tool". So in the company. It has to be automatic. Then there was a working group of people who probably didn't know very much about IT and the whole environment. And the result was simply a complicated construct that never worked. And three years later it was abolished. Because it didn't really work, it just worked a little bit. And those are the annoyances. And a certain superficiality. I mean, that's understandable. Everybody tries to do their job with the minimum of effort or cost. But I think especially when it comes to things like that, it's always wrong. You have to find the good solutions. They are expensive, but when you have them, they work.
