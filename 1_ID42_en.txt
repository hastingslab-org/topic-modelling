That's difficult, because for me it's a work tool and for me it's positive, of course, if it works and if I can open things up and if it works quickly. It annoys me when it takes too long and a patient, for example, is with us for three months, so 90 days, then everything opens very, very slowly. That's annoying then, but otherwise the tool itself only triggers something if it doesn't work. When it works, I take it for granted. And then I'm not happy about it. I get annoyed when it doesn't work. And that's why I don't have positive experiences with the tool itself. It's more content then, but that's not the tool anymore, that's when a collaboration works. I just expect it. For me, it's a given that I have a tool that's available to me, that I can work with, and that it works. And there I'm not probably not grateful enough. But I think that's the way it has to be. I have to be able to work. And then when it doesn't work, it annoys me. But that's why I find it difficult.
