No. Not at all. So I use that and I think that's actually very good that there are the things that are there. That I can fall back on it, that I can look at the patient's history. For example, if I have a patient who is now in the operating room for the fourth time, okay, I can ask why is he here at all? That I can then look at it again and look at the entire course of the patient's illness and can respond much better to the patient individually and also think about what the patient probably needs now. Also to look at X-ray images before an operation.
