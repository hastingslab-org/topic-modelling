When, after a long period of effort, there was finally an interface again, after previously struggling to get the information or having to log in separately and click through and search again, it was always a nice moment when work simply became a little easier again. I'm not the right person to ask about the PMS, because it's too deeply connected with my biography, and pride, and emotions that depend more on the fact that certain things, I think it's an extreme shame that we have electronic care documentation. Which was not used. That's painful when you've invested so much time. But someone else will tell you that it's useless, that's just as justified. But it is used throughout the canton, so the others can use it.
