I wouldn't say whether they improve the way I work. I'm responsible for that myself. But for example, when I had interviews and trial days in other hospitals, I could see what tools they had. And they had different programs. I found some better, some so worse. But the communication through some programs was between the doctors just through the program. So they only discussed things during the rounds, but otherwise the communication between the doctors and the nursing staff was through the tool.
