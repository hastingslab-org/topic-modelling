I wouldn't say that, no. So, the tools only affect me when they're slow and I feel like I'm being inefficient. Or maybe I'm impatient because they're so slow. And I have a patient waiting next to it and it takes 30 seconds for it to generate a medication list, where I think I have to explain to the patient now that it's the computer that takes 30 seconds and not me. So that too. The time aspect that it takes in part. Or if a display of a medication list is absolutely not possible for me graphically, where I have to explain to the patient, I'm sorry, but that's just the design that our system has. That probably also has something to do with my own identity, where I feel like I have to explain myself. So, I think that also has to do with that, that you identify with your operation and with everything that is part of that operation. If you ask my colleague, he thinks it has nothing at all to do with himself. So that's my personality. Because I feel I represent that. And that is very much my personality.
