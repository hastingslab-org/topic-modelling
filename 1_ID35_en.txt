The patient management system supports me extremely in my work, also from the organization. The patient management system is so fast that it updates every three seconds. That's why I always know the current status of the emergency. You can update it relatively quickly so that you know the current status. A nursing report takes a while to write, but I don't need it for my current status. And in the nursing report you set priorities for the most part, when a lot is going on and when little is going on, you can get a little longer there. You can adjust that. But the patient, what priority they have, what place they're in, how long they're there. So that's ingenious. And that was not available in the new hospital information system until now.  So the overview tool that they have, we can't work with that. And they are now working on a ward manager, which I haven't seen yet. Other hospitals used that, but they never worked electronically before. And I always realize that if you haven't worked electronically before, then you have completely different requirements than if you were already electronic. But we have been working electronically for so long now, and then you have certain requirements. And others have also said they couldn't work that way.
