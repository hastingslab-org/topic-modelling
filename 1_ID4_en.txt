So with me it is certainly always the Evernote. Because I really have the information in the shortest possible time. And then I always have the feeling that I'm actually like a cyborg. I only have to know where something is. And I no longer have to know the stuff by heart and sit down for hours, as I did in my studies. I know that after the forgetting curve according to Ebbinghaus, two thirds is gone again in a very short time anyway. And that I really have such a possibility on the evidence that I have already filtered, be it because I have read literature myself or was at a further training or through the professors or whoever present the guidelines and say that this is now the new gold standard. There you already have a filter of these huge amounts of data, and that I can directly access the filtered literature useful for me in everyday life in a second. And I think that's the most ingenious thing.
I actually feel competent for the job I have to do or was hired for. That's why I panic and check whether I have automatically set a backup on my iPhone once a day. So that, in case one of my three kids is typing around wildly again, it doesn't solve everything again, which has already happened. I may have a data loss of only a few hours, because I also feed my Evernote almost daily. That would be my biggest worry when Evernote closes down. By being an internist, I am not the specialist of in depth in any specialty, I am a specialist of breadth. I wonder how others do it who don't have an Evernote or similar language program. I have no idea how they can do their job.
