You just get insanely blocked. I didn't get into my PMS. And you can't work. It's extremely frustrating. Our IT is good. They respond very quickly and solve problems very quickly, especially during the week. But when it's the weekend and someone hasn't gotten out of the patient case and then they've called it a day. You feel that mentally, and meanwhile you can kick them out. But I can't work. I can't do anything, I can't document anything, I can't look anything up, I can't move anything in the system. Then again the ward can't continue to work because they won't transfer the patient in their system. It's just that if the technology doesn't work, then there's a huge problem. It's the same with electronics. We once had a fire somewhere in the care center, just a small fire in building 10, but we couldn't get back in. It's all just been to because everything works electronically. I think computer technology is less of a problem, because there are still laptops. So theoretically you still have electricity. But they also do it that way if someone forgets the password. We now have a good warm-up system that you can unlock yourself. But you also have to do it. They send such very good reminders every now and then how it works. They make it relatively secure when you do it then.
