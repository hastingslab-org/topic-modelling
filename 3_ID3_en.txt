That's a good question. I think the step from general medicine before to endocrinology here, the day-to-day content is different in that you work on an outpatient basis and don't have inpatients, and you have a lot more digital tools in your day-to-day work with patients. And that makes me a bit more of a digital doctor for the patients. And in the past, when I worked in the emergency department or on the wards, for example, you would analyze things on the computer in front of the room or look at results and then you would go to the patient and have a moment with the patient without digital tools. It's a different image of a doctor when you're at the patient's bedside, having a one-to-one conversation with the patient, examining and touching them, and really being able to have a personal one-to-one conversation. And it's already very technical here in everyday life, which makes my own image of my current profession a little different.
