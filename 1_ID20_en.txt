I have to be honest, I'm a big fan of the ECG software. This ECG software, it's very clear. You can pull out data that you can't see in the normal exported files in clinical information system. And you can do quite a lot with the ECG in the software. You can zoom in on the amplitudes, you can zoom in on certain things. It's very, very convenient. It's clear, it doesn't do much else. But it does the things, and it does them insanely well. It is mainly the efficiency. Exactly, you search for a patient, and then this program has all the ECGs from the last who knows how many years that were written at other hopsitals. And that, of course, is worth an insane amount. If you ever get to the point where you're writing one and you have a reason, you need a pre-ECG, and it just shows you, you can put them side by side.
