As mentioned earlier, for example, I had a patient with disc surgery, preoperatively this time-up-and-go test, she could hardly walk, had severe functional limitation due to foot lifter paresis. I also measured that objectively, before surgery After surgery it was much better. Then I still saw her four or six weeks after surgery in my consultation. Then I sort of documented all of that in my final report, and I also explained it to the patient. She was happy, I was happy, and I was also able to prove with figures that she now runs eight seconds faster than before the operation. That's really nice. That is the evidence that I have proof that I have operated well and not just subjectively write in that the patient is doing better. Then I can really prove it with numbers.
