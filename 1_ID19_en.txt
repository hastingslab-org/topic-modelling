For example, we had an operation, we needed a sieve very badly and we just didn't know where it was. We couldn't find it. In the city, we had the advantage that we had our sterilizator right downstairs and I could just call. But here, of course, it's not so quick and I can just take a quick look in the instrument management system and so look, where is the sieve, what is the status of it right now? And then, hey, it must be here somewhere in the operation room. That's got to be here. And then we knew, okay, we can look for this. And then somebody must have put this somewhere wrong, and then we found it, thank God. But we knew it was definitely here in the OR. It's a relief. It's a bit easier because it takes an incredible amount of work off the sterilizer, of course, because we don't have to bug him and say, "Hey, where's the sieve? Yes, we sent it to you. Look in the instrument management system, it's there. That's what the system is for. And that's quite nice, of course. But for this everyone must also work the system properly, for this must also always be the, the screens always be scanned. If this is forgotten once, then the whole system is already messed up and unusable.
