So yes, I had a positive situation just yesterday. I was busy all day with meetings, so accordingly not on the ward. And then I was thinking, how do I make it now to go to the ward to plan the service and the next day. And then I was thinking, we have it in OneNote now. And then I was able to plan the session on my laptop. And that was just mega cool inside. So not a stress reduction, but a relief. Simply for the time resources. That I run there to do that and run back. That was a mega positive experience.
