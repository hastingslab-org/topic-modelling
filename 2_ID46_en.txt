So, there are also many negative aspects to the radio-oncology information system or also overall to the tools that we use like that. These are simply things that are unnecessary and error-prone and wrong from my point of view. So, there's a lot of things where I also say that's bad. I mean, I have a bit of an IT background, I know how these systems could be set up and how little effort it actually takes and how much trouble it actually causes because these tools are not adapted to the needs of the doctors or the medical staff. And that's a lot of things that are simply unnecessary. For example, there is no patient list in the radio-oncology information system where I can see all my patients. For example, that doesn't exist, which would be very easy to implement. There is no medication list where it is now clearly documented between all the physicians or between all the specialties that we have with the patient, where it is clearly documented in the electronic patient record which medications the patient is currently taking. And there are also many things that you have to transfer from one system to the other system or enter the data. And, of course, that is simply unnecessary, because it could be much simpler.
