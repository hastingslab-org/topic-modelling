Yes, I think so. It's not just the way we work, but it's not just because of digitization. We are less on patients because of the fact that you have to document everything, we are more on the computer. Discharge reports are different than they were 10 or 15 years ago. In the past, you wrote, appendix, operated, bye. And now, of course, you have to write everything, what, why, what medications. So that has changed. We are by the fact that everything can be done by computer, I think, we are really more attached to the computer. So we're either in the operating room, in the consultation room, or working on the computer. I don't know how that looks to the patient. I think you notice that to some extent as well, the consultation hours that you can do digitally. During the pandemic, we did a lot of checks by telephone or by video conference tool, even when patients were not allowed to come to the hospital. I know that in many hospitals the anesthesiological consultation is done, i.e. when the patient comes in for surgery, he still has to talk to the anesthesiologist, and this is now often done by telephone. The patients also appreciate this. Then you can also send patients a lot by e-mail, i.e. prescriptions, reports, pictures, and you also communicate with patients by e-mail. I have a lot of folders with patients, where it says "Ms. Anna" and so on. So I think so. I think rather positively, I think.
