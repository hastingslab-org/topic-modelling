For some time, the computer setting was somehow not optimal for me. As I said, we started with the electronic patient shifts and separately I also need statistical programs because of the scientific evaluation of the data. And then is very dependent on whether to open this file on Windows 7 or Windows 10. And then there was a certain time where I have always had a problem to open the data of patients. And there it's frustrating, the patient is there with their companion, and I can't open the data at all. I can't even open the assignment. I don't know at all why the patient is there. And I can't show the patient the findings. And in ophthalmology we manage with multiple patients, actually relatively snappy. And if exactly these digital tools don't work, then we really have our hands closed. Really can't move forward. That has slowly improved. And we finally got that right in the end. But it keeps happening that some programs don't work properly. And we really depend on showing something to the patients. The issue is also because we're on different floors. We're not just on one floor, but I'm between 11th, 12th, 18th, 19th and 17th floors. And if something is not working somewhere, then I have to do the unit there again. And then I start running back and forth. That will improve next year, by that, that we will actually spread the clinic on one floor. But it's things like that where you're really very dependent.
