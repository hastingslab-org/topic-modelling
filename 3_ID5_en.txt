For me, it hasn't changed that much. In the sense, I still see the doctor in the center and for me, it's the surrounding systems that help me. Starting from, I mean, in the past you only operated open, so you only opened the abdomen. Today we have all the endoscopic techniques, we even have the surgical robots. I've grown along with that, so I can do all of those techniques. You used to write letters, now you write emails or WhatsApp or SMS or something. I've grown with it, so I haven't blocked it. On the contrary, I think innovation is cool, I enjoy that too. But I still see the doctor at the center. Many people have a problem with this, especially the disciplines where informatics or AI are increasingly supporting the doctor. They are already afraid, the radiologist is afraid that tomorrow he will no longer be needed. Cardiologists have the impression or the fear. So for me, I don't have these fears. I think the doctor will always need it. The way he works will change, but it's changed anyway. So I mean it's changed over the millennia and centuries, so that's not a problem for me. But the doctor's image, I think, has not changed much.
