So maybe just what I mentioned before with the electronic nursing documentation and with part of this electronic documentation. When I look back on it, that's what I was doing at the time for the internal medicine disciplines. The difficulty is always with new things, even if it is digital, that we have a very heterogeneous group of the age structure of the employees on the wards. This is particularly difficult with digital things when it comes to acceptance and often rejection at first. This was also the case with electronic nursing documentation, and there are many different reasons for this. Above all, it was noted that it was time-consuming because you have to manage two systems. And what was positive for me was that it was a resistance, and then you use something and then people see the advantages. And all of a sudden they can say that it's great and at some point they can't even imagine themselves without it. Those are the positive feelings that are then also triggered, in the sense that you also see that the benefits of efficiency gains, having information available at all times. Then of course there are also very many gains that you don't see at the moment if you don't know it. But that is for us of course in this context also a positive point and also a step towards what is coming soon anyway. It's like an intermediate step, because if at some point everything is fully digitized, from the documentation point of view, it will be more difficult from 0 to 100, so better to make the gap. Now that they're getting used to working with these media more. But then it's mainly those who find it very difficult to deal with these media in everyday life. That's just already the 50+ generation. But it's certainly easier to learn things now. That's the best example that's positive for me, because we encountered a lot of rejection and it took a lot to motivate people to cooperate and be positive. Because the tools have a benefit if you know how to use and apply them.
