If you have to be quick, if you need something quickly, whether it's the REA status, allergies, or a laboratory value, you can find it quickly. You know exactly where it is and if you think about it, if it was all in paper form, then you would have to look for the file first, leaf through it and then it can always be in a different place. And so it's just clear because you know where to find it. The important things are already better highlighted. Allergies or even FGD status, or you also have access to any X-ray images. And then you just have that quickly. And also the search function. The search function in the entire patient dossier. Then you can search for another hospital and then we find the reports from there.
