Well, of course you feel a bit closer to the ball or to the current situation compared to, let's say, colleagues who are about to retire and who are still pulling out their old hams from ten years ago. So I mean, of course, there are colleagues like that everywhere who are simply no longer up-to-date and perhaps no longer necessarily have the interest to be. Because I think that if you're interested, then you can be, and that shouldn't be a reason for failure. Perhaps you feel that your knowledge is simply more up to date. So one simply feels, also guideline-technically or there are also quite colleagues who say, guidelines do not interest me. I do it the way I have been doing it for ten or twenty years. And you just think that it's better for the patients if you stay on the ball and still have an overview of the latest studies, etc., and also apply your knowledge accordingly for the patient. Whether you are a better doctor, I always find it very, very difficult, what is a good doctor? There are also colleagues who completely follow the guidelines, but are so stubborn and then somehow do not do patient-specific medicine. I find that difficult. But in general, compared to someone who, as I said, has been doing and treating exactly the same thing for ten or twenty years, I think it's definitely better to use more up-to-date tools and guidelines. We have progress in medicine and I think you can also use that if you know things that you didn't know ten years ago. Perhaps with the risk that a few years later you realize, okay, that wasn't so correct after all. There is always a risk, of course, because knowledge is in flux. But I've seldom had a situation where I've followed guidelines and then realized afterwards that it wasn't so good after all. That is rather rare. So most of the time it really is a benefit for the patient, a progress, if you stick to it.
