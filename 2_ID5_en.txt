Murderousness. I am actually an extremely patient nature. I am insanely patient with patients. I also have insane patience to show or assist an attending or a resident in the procedure. I'm insanely patient. And I don't really get rattled very quickly. The computer manages that every now and then, because that's just a tool for me and it just has to go. And if it doesn't work, then I have no patience. So maybe an anecdote about that. A few years ago, a female prosecutor was sitting in the consulting room and then it crashed again and froze and so on. And I asked her how long I would have to go to jail if I strangled a computer scientist. And then she jokingly said, that's self-defense, that's not a problem at all. So as an anecdote that I then already think over at the moment.
