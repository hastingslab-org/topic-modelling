So, the danger exists, but I think rather not. I don't see myself as a doctor any differently, whether I have a tool or not. Maybe it also has to do with professional experience, after 24 years, maybe it has to do with that. But if you're fresh out of medical school and you're coming into this system and you first have to develop as a physician and you're working with certain tools from the beginning, that could have an impact. What we notice very strongly, of course, is this omnipresent discussion with the younger generations. They have a different approach to IT and to information procurement, etc. They don't look at it the same way. But they also look at it very differently. They are different in how they evaluate and then reuse or filter it. It's more the tendency for younger people to simply fetch comprehensive information and then simply pass it on unfiltered. This leads, for example, to long lists of diagnoses suddenly being available in a hospital information system, because everyone then copies and pastes them in. And no one checks to see if the same thing is already in there three times.
