That the program is very slow and that there is no program that can do everything. So also that you have to switch between the programs. And that the programs do not work together. We know exactly, the key point between the systems is not 100% compatible. That always leads to problems. And IT itself sees that. The reasons why you do it that way is that I stopped questioning a long time ago, because you don't get a real explanation, it's probably as always about the money. Be it is too expensive to install anything or make it work better. Actually, it's also the speed of the program, because I think if the program works like, for example, my normal 0815 PC at home, then I would already be satisfied. That would be enough for me. And the screen time in general, I think it's a matter of scheduling. Many of my older colleagues say "there is so much to document and you are with the patient much less". I have to say that if you know the ten-finger system and if you are the generation that grew up with it, then in my opinion you are faster on the PC and you have more time with the patients. So the ten-finger system I think is very essential when you're working with laptops or computers, because if you don't master that, of course you're much slower.
