That's difficult to say. I grew up with it. Since I've been creating, there haven't been any big changes. I grew up with that in the medical world. Especially when you come to a consultation badly prepared, that you often look something up on the computer and at the same time you're still half talking to the patient and in the end you're half here and half there. That is relatively inefficient. But otherwise, there has not been a big change.
