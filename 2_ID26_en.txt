Negative is rather when we have technical problems and the availability is limited. As an example, last week I was blocked from an account at KSSG by mistake. And if a support staff member doesn't recognize the urgency, then it can have quite an impact. We absolutely depend on these tools seven days, 24 hours a week. And unfortunately, not everyone realizes that when the IT service only covers office hours.
