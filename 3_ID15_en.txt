So I would, if I could wish for something, I would take out the word processing. I would file lists of progress lists, what was done chronologically one after the other, so that if you want to know quickly what you have already done, you have an overview. But if I want to have a summary case, then I would like that to be described briefly and precisely. That is actually the wish of all people, including the referring physician, that they know briefly and precisely what it was all about. Not that I take the step of noting that I have an addendum on the third page down.
