Yes, it should actually, or it would be desirable, but that would be assistance systems. They will never replace people. But I believe that we can not only become more efficient, but perhaps also more effective. And I think you can raise quality or, above all, avoid mistakes. There are certain interaction checks or certain differential diagnostic considerations, i.e. a clever algorithm that offers you what it could be, so "I didn't think that" or "that would help". And then very simply also safety things. So, checking for side effects, I mean all the interactions, no human can have that in their head. And a tool does that. That already exists. We just don't have it yet. We will get it soon. But that is helpful. And simply automate as many processes administratively as possible. That helps when you don't have to do that anymore. But the next step would be for tools to actually assist. In decision-making, for example, just so suggestions, not directly take over, but think we still have to ourselves, but help. I think you could probably speed up the process and raise the quality somewhat.
