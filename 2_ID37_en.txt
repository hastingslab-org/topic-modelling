That's referring to IT as a whole, not even to tools. When IT doesn't work, I'm very impatient. For me, it's a tool, if some PC doesn't work for me, I could theoretically just go home again. That's already often, the more tools, the more electronic stuff, the more vulnerable the system as a whole becomes. I notice that already. I'm not always completely satisfied with our IT. I don't always find that they do the job that I think they should do. Of course, that's hard again as a user. I expect to be able to work with my IT. And if there are IT problems, then yes, but I need an infrastructure that is made available to me, that works. And as best as possible also map all the tools that I need to work. That's actually already like we said earlier. There are no things that I don't use. No, I would rather use more. For me, there are things that I need to do myself now in analog or in some other form that I'm missing that should be available to me. That's the thing that sometimes already upsets me or gives me uncomfortable feelings. Because I know it would be possible, but somehow it's not possible for us. And when there is an IT problem that can't be solved or someone calls me and says at the end that I can't help, and it takes half a day to solve the problem. These are the negative feelings. But I can't say that about the tools themselves in terms of application and use. In the case of the hospital information system, it was a project that was to be rolled out. It was rolled out at an external site, it worked well there, then they wanted to roll it out in the center, but then it no longer worked in the center. There were certainly various reasons for this and colleagues who opposed it. That annoyed me, too, of course. We were on the verge of using something super. I was also involved in certain projects. And I saw it's not the best system, but you can work well with that. You can work with that better than you can work with physical documentation. Those are already things that excite you. When it doesn't come, and you would like it to. But with these tools that I have on a day-to-day basis, I don't have any bad feelings about it. Sometimes it's just a little slow, but maybe that's my impatience.
