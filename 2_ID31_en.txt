Yes, I do not know now whether the situation is appropriate to your topic. I'll just tell it now, you can tell it otherwise. For example, with performance recording. The tool itself is great and performance recording is also very important. It's just that what results from the digital capture, that's also again a topic from before that maybe people forget a little bit. The tool then generates a number, which of course one has recorded and this number then actually says whether our workload is too much, enough or too little. And that is me sometimes a little bit difficult to argue also, because you see only this number. And maybe we had a learner who needed three hours of support from us, but then we can't record that. Or I had a staff meeting because someone's grandmother just died, that one hour went. That is perhaps a negative effect if you only look at this number at the end of the month and don't actually ask how this month was for you and for your employees.
