So really, the S-Key for example, that was mega great for me personally. We change so quickly, when I operate, I go out of the operation, I want to dictate something quickly. But I have to have my image area, my surface. Then I can just stop the S-Key and everything comes out the way I left it. Even at home, when I access at home, I have my surface. It just goes mega long, even home access goes long. For that it should go fast, I have the feeling it goes too long. But I have my stuff again. I find that super. I think that's extremely great. Yes, I think it's just always nice and it satisfies me when things work out, when I don't have the feeling that I have to wait all the time. After all, it's always processes that are a waste of time.
