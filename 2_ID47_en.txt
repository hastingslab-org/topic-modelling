I think it's negative when it's actually in everyday life, and there are many tools that are coming now at the moment, it's a huge market and a total boom. And tools are being developed everywhere and they just simply don't help. They're of no use because they're not thought of from the right place. Or you digitize what you can digitize, and you measure what you can measure, even though nobody actually wants that measured. Those are a couple of questions. And if it just doesn't work. If the data quality is not right at the end. That's the negative. But we said, we put in few of those things. They all fly out before. Also with the data, so the health date. Everybody can measure at the moment with his watch, with his cell phone, with his Whatever. It confuses the patients, it's of no use to the doctors. And you just measured it because you can measure it. There would already be things you could measure that would help you. But the IT scene thinks differently. And it's not easy to bring that together. It's very, very difficult for them to start from the user's point of view. They have a tool, mostly in research, then they get out as quickly as possible, a spin-off, start-up, exit as quickly as possible, sell. That's also understandable, that's also good. But very little is coming out at the moment. Nothing is coming out. What's going on in everyday life? All the newspapers are constantly full of what you're doing digitally here. And there's another start-up, there's another prize. And we're doing the work on the patient here and thinking "What's really in everyday life now?", "What has really caught on?". Nothing, we don't have a single digital tool that we are using at the moment.
