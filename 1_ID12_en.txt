So honestly, I still find the invention very cool with the navigation, for example, that we can use intraoperatively. That fascinates me very much and I would also like to be able to understand better how that works, because it just interests me very much and I think it's really cool that we can do that and use it. This the navigation software, where we actually read in the images of the patient and then preoperatively mark certain markers or landmarks on the patient using a reference star and then the software calculates at what distance which location is then from this reference star and we can then, for example, go to the tumor with pinpoint accuracy. Make the craniotomy exactly there, make the skin incision exactly there. I think that's really very, very cool and I think that has had a very positive influence on life in neurosurgery in particular and has made it much safer for the patient. So I think that's really a very cool invention. And otherwise, I find technology, well, I sometimes have the feeling that certain software makes our lives more difficult than easier, and I find, for example, that it has made the lives of surgeons easier and the lives of patients safer, and it's really efficient and good, and that's how technology should actually be used in medicine.
