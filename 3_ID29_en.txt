I think that I've become a doctor now in the time where it's more and more established and more and more normal and I've also grown up with all the digital media, it doesn't really make any difference to me, I would say. If anything, it takes work away. Whether I can spend more time with the patient is another question, but certainly more than if I still had to write the letters myself. And that's why it doesn't make any difference to me, or I don't see myself any less as a doctor as a result.
