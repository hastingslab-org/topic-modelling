I think what has already changed, in the past you could delegate more in this respect. A senior physician probably didn't do many things himself, but had colleagues to whom he could delegate. Now that falls back on you. That's fine, I became a senior physician with that. I don't know the other one. But in the past it was certainly the case that a senior physician had a secretary and said, you are the lawyer and take care of all that. And then you also dictated a letter rather than sending an email, for example. So I think people who have experienced all that historically, that has certainly changed. I'm not that young anymore, but when it works and it's good tools, it makes me feel younger to be part of the development. I also think that there are quite a lot of opportunities in the context of digitization and probably we use far too little. I'll talk to you later about your training as a molecular oncologist. I was also in contact with Ms. Hastings regarding the molecular tumor board. There we would be happy if we could bring more digital tools to bear and not have to search for colleagues in 25 databases, but that there would be an integration option. I am open to this and actually feel agile if I can participate to some extent.
