Now at the hospital, the many different programs have no interfaces. There are no interfaces, it always takes human intervention to switch from one program to another. That is frustration, because it would not be a problem. And it's unwillingness to implement it. That's frustration, because it's been going on for probably 15 years, it wouldn't be a problem at all. Or much longer. Or pure inability. I am more inefficient and it generates huge amounts and overheads. When I look at these administrative processes, including these IT systems, I am not surprised that the hospital is not in the black. That's not a question for me. It's so inefficient. And then we have to save on the patients. Or the assistants have overtime. And in that time where they have to service these interfaces, they can't be with the patient or they can't go home early. That's frustrating.
