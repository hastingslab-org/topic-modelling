When something doesn't work, I always get upset. Or often when the computer does not go up or it does not work. What I have said now, that can of course also be a curse if someone neurotic and all ECGs always sends you to your e-mail or always calls you. There I have already examples, there I have already known the people on the number that appears on the phone. Then you think, should I pick up again at all. Of course, depending on the processing of patients, this can also be difficult for us. But the tool itself is not responsible for that.
