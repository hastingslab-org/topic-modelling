No, it's hard because it's such a mundane thing and not such an experience. If it works, it's more that you take that as a prerequisite or an expectation. It's the expectation that it works and it helps you. And one is not positively surprised now when it works. On the contrary, you can actually only be disappointed. I think there are many situations just when, again the example of navigation, because it's just the biggest tool is for us. If you have a difficult anatomy, also patients, where the anatomy is difficult to understand, then you are grateful for the anatomy, it because either makes the surgery possible in the first place or just makes it safer. And negative examples abound, when there are errors in the registration and you don't realize it and that's why you make mistakes. Or the very banal things, as every person knows, with the programs you have to deal with when it doesn't work.
