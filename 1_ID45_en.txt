Well, text modules have been helpful in everyday life. And otherwise we've moved from a system to a dashboard. The system was sort of established in our clinical dashboard. And when you registered as a doctor for a patient, you automatically received the findings in the dashboard. That was super helpful, because then I had to click through to the patient archive to see whether the findings were already there or not. Instead, it was automatically sent to me in my dashboard. Then I looked in my inbox, in my notification there and I could just see it right there. That was super helpful. That was great because it really saved me time. Whether it was blood cultures or an ECG. I knew right away if it was running. And if I didn't have it in, I knew I didn't have to check it at all. That was convenient.
