That's where I found the hospital information system, for example. That's a very good example, because as I said, in the other they still make prescriptions for patients with a pencil, for example. So there, for example, they write Dafalgan four times a gram, IV, so by infusion. And when we do the electronic curve or medication prescription in Rorschach and now also in Wil, it's all done electronically, and that's safer for patients. But you really have to write it in detail and the program makes it so that you really have to look very carefully at what dosage, what form of medication, you have to know a little bit about that, what infusions, I found that very tedious. So I can do that now, for example, because I can do that, for me it's more tedious to ask for something like that. I found that a bit more complicated. And yes, I found that with the tool, but that's really because of the tool, that he's unfriendly, because I know that from another city, I think, that's the hospital information system, and is more modern set up and there just runs fluently the whole thing.
