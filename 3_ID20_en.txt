That's a good question. So, of course, I used to have the idea that I would spend more time with patients. Right now, I'm just spending time with the computer. And there are so many different forms now and different places where you have to document things. And right now I'm writing everything twice. On the department where I am, I write a history entry with procedure, and then I go and write another separate procedure in another order entry. That's just time wasting, it's very irritating. What's also troublesome is that the patients perceive that. The patients also say that, especially the older ones. Because when I talk to the patients, I have to type along the way. Because I don't have the time to sit down afterwards and write down what he says. I'm good at typing, I can look at the patients when I'm talking to them and write along the way. Which many people also find very irritating. Because they then have the feeling that they're not really listening to me. Which I also understand, or I don't want anyone to stenograph while I'm talking to them. You can't take that seriously, but it just doesn't work any other way in my everyday life. It's efficient, of course, and that's good, but the image you have of it, or of the person doing it, I think is more negative. Because you always have this certain distance. We still have these ergothons now. At least there I can still sit next to the patients when I talk to them. In all the general practitioners' offices, it's really the case that you have this huge monitor between the patient and the doctor. And with me, the patient can at least still kind of look at my screen if it's his file or what's in the case. Then he can at least still watch there and know what it's about and feel completely excluded. Otherwise, it feels more and more like an interaction between doctor and monitor and not doctor and patient.
