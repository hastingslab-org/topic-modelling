That's a good question. Aldo, I have to say, I once watched an insightful TED Talk. There it was nicely described, where earlier at the chess world championships once Kasparov played against Deep Blue and then Deep Blue won. And then Kasparov also equipped himself with a computer and played against a chess computer, so to speak augmented and then won again afterwards. And that's how I feel, actually. So I think it's not about, I quasi as a classic traditional doctor, with what I have learned by heart, versus digital tools, but I need them now. For me, they're not enemies, they're my friends that help me, augment me. Just like Evernote, I think that's the best example. Evernote alone wouldn't work because it doesn't know when to reproduce what. But I know where to get my factual knowledge. But I certainly still need action knowledge or action competence, because these data, that's just factual knowledge, from that, I find it mega exciting. I am mega happy that I can live and work like this now. I sometimes wonder how people used to do it. They probably had to memorize a lot more, compared to how we do it today. I don't really memorize anything anymore.
