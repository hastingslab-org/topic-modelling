It is quite annoying. If you have 30 patients here, then I can't still think where everyone is, you have so many other thoughts and it just has to work. But what I also have to tell you, I worked here a time ago when everything was on paper. And then you still had a book where you wrote down the emergency. And that team, that was 25 years ago, was terrified of the step into informatics. We were madly attached to that book. And then two days after the switch, nobody wanted that book. It happened really fast. And now we can't live without it. There is always a maintenance window on Thursday evening. That is also used in part, we are also affected in part. And that is a disaster for us. And when the patient management system is affected, that's a disaster for us. You no longer have an overview. We do have an outage concept with boards and everything, but it's difficult. We are highly dependent on that.
