Yes, radio-oncology is a technical subject that needs a lot of software in the first place. I mean, it wasn't always like that, radio-oncology is a very old subject, it's been around since the beginning of the 20th century, when they didn't use computers and software. So, it's already the case that this has been very much shaped by digital changes, digitization and advances in computer science. But it's definitely being changed, it's going to continue to be changed, now by new things like AI and the like. We also have AI-powered software that we use here as well, which also takes a lot of work off our hands that we used to have to do completely on our own. So it's necessary in radio-oncology. And the important thing is that it should actually be ideally tailored to our needs, that it ultimately brings the best.
