Yes, it's a frustration on a daily basis with this program that we're there with. It's just very inefficient. As I said, it takes forever to get from one to the other. You have to make a lot of clicks, a lot of unnecessary clicks. There's information stored in different places. You can only open one program at a time. It is very confusing. There are a lot less options compared to clinical information system. In the clinical information system, you also have the option of, if your senior physician now corrects a letter, then you can look at the before-and-after version and can then see what was done wrong. I had a very big learning effect there.
