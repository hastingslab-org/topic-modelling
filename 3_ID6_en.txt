Yes. Yes, it is very different from using paper. So, I think that as a physician, I have more, much more opportunity to have access to data. And it is not something that is time and site location because in the past when we wanted to see the information of a patient, we need to go and look for his paper folder. If you want to see the past information, we need to see the archive and go to the archive to ask and wait. And if I have the data,
my colleagues, they cannot access it. Now we can all access the data, work as a team, and collaborate. So yes, so it really changed the way we work as physicians and we have this superpower in the term of accessing data and modifying it, etc.
