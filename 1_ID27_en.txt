The most positive thing at the moment are these apps where I feel like I'm getting timely important results from congresses. And then they discuss things right away in a pretty amusing way and still very direct, which is often not in the medical world. I would say that's good. The aspects are certainly good availability. I can listen to that in the evening when I'm cooking on the side and there's still humor there. And still I have the important knowledge content that is also relevant to me in everyday life.
