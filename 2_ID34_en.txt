And negative that it didn't work. We had so many times a failure of the hospital information system in the anesthesia. Then we had to write all the operating rooms and everything on paper. So back to the roots. And that didn't help that much either. So more trouble than it was worth. And these outages happened at least once a week. So that was super often. And that was super annoying.
