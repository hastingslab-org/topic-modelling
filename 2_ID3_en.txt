I think that this program with this cardiac rhythm monitoring that was introduced, that I had a few years ago, that was just introduced. We were trained on it. I had a half hour introduction to it and the new program was significantly worse than the old one. It took a lot more time to do the same job. It also causes uncertainty as to whether the program really recognizes everything you need to see, because it has documented so much fake stuff, so it's frustrating because the effort is greater, because the old program was actually better and could do it well. Then you ask yourself why you need a new one. It's a helplessness, because now I just have to deal with it. And the person who made the decision, or the person who doesn't have to deal with it on a day-to-day basis, feels a certain fear and also a certain insecurity because they might miss out on certain things because the program produces so much useless information that they might underestimate certain things for the patient or make the wrong decision.
