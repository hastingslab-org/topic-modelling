Not for myself. I grew up with it, so maybe it's a generational question. But I do think that the older generation appreciates it when you don't always look at the screen, but also on paper and don't always have the screen between your two faces. I can understand that, but there are also practical reasons. And I wouldn't want to miss having that either. And it is also safer to write it on the PC. Everybody can read it and the treatments are clear. You can access it from anywhere. You don't have to be on site. If you are on night duty, you can do it from the PC. That's a lot easier. You just can't do without it.
