Yes, I find the emergency tool quite good in the clinical information system. You can simply click on the medications. They don't have to be prescribed, but you can simply click on them if there's an emergency situation, adrenaline I have to administer now, 1mg pure. In a rehab situation, I can click that directly. I think that's very positive because it's big, manageable. The medications are indicated in different colors. I think that's a very positive tool, which makes it easy to work with. You just have it all in one place. You can also click on rehab. For an emergency situation, they did that very well. I think things have to happen quickly in a crisis situation. It has to be quickly tangible, it has to be easy to grasp. The design is very simple. There are round buttons. They all have different backgrounds and are also well sorted in terms of sequence. It's very easy to find your way around in a crisis situation. That's what I find appealing about the system at the moment, and it's easy to implement. Since I would find it super, if one would give there now still another EC, if there would be below also a bar. I was the 1st year after the course on the heart and vascular surgery. There we often had hemorrhagic shock and had to give an incredible number of ECs. Sometimes we gave 10 or 12 ECs. If you have to open all of them in clinical information system and scan them, it would be great if you could just click on an EC in PDMS from the emergency button and administer it. That would make the process a little bit easier. But otherwise, I'm sure there's a lot of gap. But I would consider that a positive. I think that emergency page is good. Acutcare is the name of it, I think.
