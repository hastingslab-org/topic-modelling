What I personally find is, if I'm working in a surgery now, for example, and I can look up whether my patient was already there two weeks ago, then I quickly go back and read what the issues were back then. And then you're already one step ahead. Because there are things that sometimes become problematic. Now if a patient says it's going well and he's going home, then I can read up, and you try, and then you see though that it's not going, and then I can react much earlier. Then you can plan everything a little bit earlier or get things going. Or you can tell the doctors that it didn't work. We tried that, we tried this and that last time. You avoid trying the same issues over and over again when you know it's not going to work. The people who keep coming back, who sometimes can be manipulative because they keep being in the hospital or on painkillers. Then you just get ahead of it. Or the patients who come again and again, with borderline symptoms, you have to know how to approach these people. Through electronic documentation, you have everything that you can simply retrieve quickly. This also makes life easier for you. You avoid playing off against each other and being manipulative if you are one step ahead. You hedge your bets and also protect yourself. There are patients, when they come, there is a warning. There is then special documentation because it's the same themes over and over again. Whether it's medication abuse, violence, or just about anything. I think that's very important that that's automatically filed. That only works electronically, because it doesn't work that you've only heard a name before and then I go and see what's what. And depending on who is working, you know him or not. That's how you protect yourself.
