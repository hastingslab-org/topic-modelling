Yes, so really situations where I didn't see things in the electronic patient record that could have been seen. Where I therefore didn't have the important information and therefore made a wrong decision in the treatment of a patient. That is annoying and annoying. Even if it doesn't result in a harm event, it's just not good. Even down to the reputation for the clinic. We are primarily advisory. When a colleague calls me and wants advice from me, they expect to be advised correctly. If I can't provide this service, it's not good for my offer.
