Difficult question. I don't think I can just pin it down to one particular situation. After gradually getting to know the functions better and better and seeing where it can take work off your hands. The overall experience with the clinic information system has been positive. I know it differently from other clinics or from former fellow students who sometimes have three or four different programs that they have to access for X-ray registration, for viewing images and for laboratory evaluations. I find it very positive with the clinic information system that everything simply works in one program. You don't have to open any external programs. The overall experience is that it significantly reduces the workload.
