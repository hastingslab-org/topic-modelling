I think it's now simply an aspect of digitalization that is added to our work. I think it makes things even more professional and that you have to adapt to more new things in our profession. It will come, there will be support, and because of the shortage of care, the same problem is everywhere. I think it's very important that we accept this and look at how we can simplify our lives through digitization and not invest so many resources in documentation. Instead, we should spend more time on the important things that make up my job or our job, and say that we actually want to spend time with patients and want to outsource as much as possible digitally what is not directly related to patients. I think that definitely brings an advantage for us as well.
