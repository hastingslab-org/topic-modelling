Yes, I do. I find it extremely interesting, but you really have to say that many facilities don't give much time to the patient. And you can't replace a lot of things digitally from nursing. You can't. All the monitoring, even post-op, you still have to go to the patient to make a good assessment.  Just purely from the data you have with screens, you haven't done any monitoring and assessment. That is a danger. A lot of people think they can work even faster and take on more patients, but you have to be realistic about that. You're not that much more efficient. The interprofessional for sure or management supports planning, but purely in patient care you don't have a lot of time savings.
