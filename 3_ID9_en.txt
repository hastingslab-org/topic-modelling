So, I think they would influence me if I had more. I am of the opinion, and I have also discussed this with Alina quite often, that there is an insane potential where you could simplify your life, where you could also transport this into science, for example data acquisition, etc. Accordingly, I think it is simply the case that there is currently too little on offer. Accordingly, I think it is simply the case that there is currently too little on offer, so I think the offer is simply too little in general, so that it can somehow influence me extremely now. I think the paths are too long for that in our company. Of course, we can do it through our superiors, but I think it's a cascade that you have to climb. And I already know that the hospital, I think, offers a platform especially to young start-ups, Swiss start-ups. Even these apps that we use, I think for the most part they're all Swiss startups that have been promoted there. But I think that's just always a financial question. The university hospitals are doing badly. And accordingly, I don't see the megapotential there yet. I think the smaller hospitals are further ahead. They use it more intelligently because they are also more resource-efficient. And we are a bit behind, I would say.
