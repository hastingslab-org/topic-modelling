I recently had a situation during my service last week, where a very complicated question was brought to me, where I knew that if I really wanted to answer this seriously, I would have to invest 1-2 hours. I then, not knowing that this exists, simply searched in our guidelines system. And then I found a cookbook that allowed me to answer that question within a couple of minutes. That was very cool. From the emotions, of course, it was relief, in the sense of saving time, at 12 o'clock at night. And on the other hand, of course, a certain pride, because this is our system and comes from our team, because quasi proactively such questions are answered before they occur. And before they arise, that's probably the reason that there has been. But that we're sort of trying to map all possible and impossible situations and make the knowledge accessible that way. That's been very cool.
