Absolutely. I'm extremely looking forward to it. Because I think that the traditional image of a doctor is that there are these old, gray-faced men who are sort of omniscient because they have a lot of experience to fall back on. And in the old days, in the pre-internet days, it was definitely like that because the information wasn't readily available. That has changed a bit with the Internet. But it's still the case that experience and knowledge is still an asset. And I think as soon as these tools become trustworthy enough that you can be relatively sure that they provide the right information, that would fall away. And then, from my perspective, the medical profession would become very different. Because the knowledge is there, accessible, in real time. Then you would be able to go cookbook. And it would change in the direction of how do I bring the evidence-based information to the particular person who needs this treatment? And how do I translate that for that person? How do I notice what that person really needs and really wants? What is good and what is not? So the interpersonal track again becomes much more important than purely technical or expertise.
