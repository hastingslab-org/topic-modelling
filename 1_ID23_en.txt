So, we also worked a lot on our tools and started to develop ourselves. There is a tool, which is an operation management tool for planning and also for documentation. And there we have in principle, when the operation is ready for the prescription and what should happen afterwards, we have had great influence on this program and could have a lot of say in the development and that has become really good. Because that is to a large extent integrated into the progress. It's just the way it is in a hospital, if the tools you have available are not good or are insufficient, we have employed our own computer scientists in the clinic for years, who have nothing to do with the IT department. That's now three people. We simply develop what we need ourselves at our own expense. And these are the results of our success. Because there we really get what we need, tailored to our process, without having to enter redundant data. In this respect, we are perhaps also in a pioneering position with surgery. We can pull together data from everywhere and then create our own images for ourselves and create possibilities that bring us something in our everyday lives. These are the really good, positive things that we can do in everyday life.
