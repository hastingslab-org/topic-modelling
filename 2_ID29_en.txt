Once we had this planned system reset, that was very exhausting. Because when you have to switch everything to paper, we have all the forms for that, but of course you don't work with them in normal everyday life and you've never filled them out before. And when you're in the emergency room and there are a lot of patients waiting and you have to tick off every single X-ray image manually and have to go through all the paperwork, it's a complete disaster. Or when lab results only come out of the printer and you have to run to the lab to get them.
