I think when you go into intensive care, you have to deal with the fact that it's very technical. All the equipment you have to operate, the documentation, it's all very technical and I think that does something to you. It's not quite as personal anymore, it's not quite as social partly because it's just a program. I think it does something to you. I think in normal wards, where you weren't sitting at the PC as much, you were more interactive. Now you're not diving in with your colleagues because you're like, I still have to document. And that also does something to your time management because you always know you can't just focus on nursing and on rounds, you also still have to have in the back of your mind, I still have to document and also always take yourself back. I think it's also a concentration thing, just like when you draw up medication, you always have to be concentrated, go through everything, have I documented everything.
