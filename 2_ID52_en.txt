Yes, so I am now in the lucky advantage that I have a laptop and the system runs relatively stable. But there are always some assistants where the system suddenly crashes. If you've already written half a letter and haven't saved it, then you just start over again. Fortunately, that doesn't affect me that much. The other thing that sometimes annoys me again is that our reports are generated from the system and into a Word document. The Word document is then edited by various people using Track-Change. Then at the end, the secretary has to play that back into the information system. There is a lot of redundancy and unnecessary steps where you think.... We complain that the health care system, which is so expensive, and it doesn't work better. Or then the document is lost again, or someone has switched off a track change and then the secretaries at the front of the office don't see what has been changed and what they now have to play back into the system. And if nothing has been changed at all, then they can close it right away.
