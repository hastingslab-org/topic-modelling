I mean, the positive thing is that it exists at all. It always depends on where we look. I've also seen it happen that it was off. I think that was in the other city, where everything was on paper again for a week. It always depends on where we're looking from. Of course, it's already worth its weight in gold that you can document there, that you can look at the lab, that it all exists at all and that you can also look at the reports and x-rays. That is very cool.
