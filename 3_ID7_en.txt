Yeah, I think it's just super convenient. I think it's fun because it's so interactive, a lot of these things. And because it actually allows me, just for example the dictation thing, to do my work in a way that I enjoy more. Also the photography thing, that simplifies a lot of things. That's why I actually enjoy my work more.
