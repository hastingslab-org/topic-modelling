So I was asking last week who is actually controlling who. I recently asked myself whether the machine is really just there to support you, so to speak, or whether I'm practically a little ant that's really just there to do what the machine can't do. That is, to establish this link between the patient and the machine. Like, for example, we can't enter the vital signs automatically, you always have to do it manually. Yes, when you then enter 30 pieces of information into this system, I often just feel like an ant.
